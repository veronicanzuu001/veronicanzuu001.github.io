                    <p>Femme_furies empowerment program is a small intiative for helping needy children in Mombasa,Kenya.It started in the year 2022 November 22nd by a young lady by the name Veronica Nzuu,she is a kenyan by birth and a resident of Mombasa county.She is born and raised in Mombasa so she is very familiar with the Mombasa area.Veronica Nzuu comes from a very humble background of six children and her being the second and the First daughter of Mr and Mrs Michael Mulu,she has always been very responsible towards her siblings and very loving around kids for her children are a source of Joy and belonging.After the COVID-19 pandemic Veronica Nzuu was very affected by the situation in her family and this drived her in to stage one of depression which was really disturbing for her she occasionally had suicidal thoughts but thanks she did not attempt any of that. One evening as she was walking in her home area in a very far deserted place where she could go and refresh her mind she saw something unsual although she did not act on it she kept it on her mind .The incident she saw was of two young children of the age of ten-twelve years sitted together with very sad faces they were from crying but she did not act or ask them anything.</p><p>That incident gave her very sleepless nights she kept on thinking of what happened to the young children because she was familiar with her home area and she knew the possible things that could have happened to the kids.After a week of thoughts on the incident,she decided that she would help the children in her home area because the pandemic had destroyed alot of families and most of the children were left home alone in thoughts majority of them never went to school because of family crisis and financial crisis.This was very painful and hurting... and for Veronica a 22 year old at the time it was way stressing because she wanted to help but she was jobless and had no money obviously she was in a very difficult position in her life to help this children.What will surprise you now is the she started the small initiative anyway,she could meet this children sang songs with them told stories with them and she was able to put smiles on the children faces for her that was a very big achievement.<p/>
                        <p>She started the program with only 5 children and what will surprise you is that in three months she had hit 150 children her own parents and siblings were so impressed with her achievement and they help her maintain the children.Most especially her loving mother Pheris Faith who will never go unrecognisable because she helps her believe in herself every single moment and also she helps her with her backyard where she meets this wonderful children.Veronica Nzuu mostly known as Vera/Bosslady by her peers has made afew of her home area kids dream come true by taking them to places where most of the kids had never visited also by taking five handsome young boys to school which is a very big achievement for a 22 year old young lady struggling with her own fears.<p/><p>What inspired her is not only the young two children that she met that evening,she has always had and have a very big heart for people most especially children and for her she always has this favourite quote "A win for the community is a win for all of us" which keeps her going despite the obstacles in her life 
                        .She dreams on getting more partners and of helping children all around the Mombasa county so as she can put as many smiles as she can to every kid in the informal settlement,and thats her big dream</p>
